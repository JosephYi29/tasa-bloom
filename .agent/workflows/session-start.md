1. Read `PLANNING.md` to understand the current project phase and context.
2. After completing each major phase, prompt the user to push their changes to Git.
3. After each significant code change, update both the `PLANNING.md` and `testing.md` documents to reflect the current state.
4. If any new persistent instructions or context are discovered, update this `session-start.md` file with the new important information.
