description: Steps the agent should take at the beginning of a coding session or during code changes
---

1. Read `PLANNING.md` to understand the current project phase and context.
2. Group your work into meaningful commits. Only execute `git commit` when a major task is completed (such as at the end of a session), rather than committing after every single small file change.
3. After each significant code change, update both the `PLANNING.md` and `testing.md` documents to reflect the current state.
4. If any new persistent instructions or context are discovered, update this `session-start.md` file with the new important information.
